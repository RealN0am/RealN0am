 **ZLIB Compressor & Decompressor - by UrMango!**
 While learning about other virtual worlds made in flash, I discovered a data compression type called ZLIB.
 ZLIB is a compression that is mostly used for archives (and is very similar to zip and gzip), but is also used for compressing binary files separately.

While working with these virtual world files, I discovered using ZLIB for binary files isn't an easy task to do even in flash, and I decided to make it easier to use with a simple C# project outputing the results to a file.
