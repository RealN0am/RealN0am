 **ZLIB Compressor & Decompressor - by UrMango!**
 
 While learning about other virtual worlds made in flash, I discovered a data compression type called ZLIB they use to compress files.
 ZLIB is a compression that is mostly used for archives (and is very similar to zip and gzip), but is also used for compressing binary files separately.

While working with the files, I discovered using ZLIB for binary files isn't an easy task to do even in flash, and I decided to make it easier to use with a simple C# project outputing the results to a file.
